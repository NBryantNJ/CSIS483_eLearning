*Many functions aren’t working yet.	

Development Progress based off the WBS:
Plans 1.0 (Planning) & 2.0 Phase 1 Development are finished. 
 The structure of the application now includes a basic UI with minor functionality on each page. 

Development Progress Page by Page:

•	Home Page
Basic UI is complete, no functionality yet. Courses are put there as placeholders for the time being.

•	Reports Page
Basic UI is complete, no functionality yet. Report table is put there as a placeholder for the time being.

•	Admin Page
Some functionalities but not complete. The page is able to tell if a user has admin access or not. The server will only disperse the code for admin functionality if the user has the privilege. 

•	Support Page
Completed. Has error checking on the frontend and backend code. Emails get sent out by the bot with information. (Further improvements may come if needed)

•	User signup page
Completed. However, more functionality will likely be added on if there’s extra time.

•	Website header bar with page links and login icon:
All page links work, but not all pages are complete.
The Login function works and so does google captcha.

•	Citations
Free logos and pictures were given approval to be used either by owners or description left by owners. *Citations for pictures and logos still has to be made on separate page.
